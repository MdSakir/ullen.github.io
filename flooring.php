                        <p>Flooring is the term which means the lower enclosing surface of spaces within the building. The flooring may be part of the floor structure, such as the upper surface of floorboards or concrete slab, but in general, it is a permanent covering lay over the floor. Flooring can also be used for describing the process of laying flooring material.</p>
                        <p><strong>Domestic flooring </strong></p>
                        <p>It is most common for domestic flooring which is installed on a room by room, basis rather than using only one material&nbsp;throughout. Different flooring is fitted for different rooms.</p>
                        <p>Bedroom: carpet is the most popular choice, although&nbsp;wood, laminate, or vinyl are suitable.</p>
                        <p>Kitchen: Vinyl is the best choice as it doesn&rsquo;t affect by&nbsp;water, and easily cleaned, and has&nbsp;durability.&nbsp;There are many options like Tiles and Marble flooring option.</p>
                        <p>Landings/stairs: The majority of the upper area carpeted for occupants&nbsp;will most likely be walking around without shoes and harder&nbsp;flooring&nbsp;can be noisy.</p>
                        <p>Bathroom/wet&nbsp;areas: Untreated&nbsp;timber&nbsp;is unsuitable for these&nbsp;rooms, and&nbsp;carpets&nbsp;can become wet and unhygienic.</p>
