                        <p>Just as a building is incomplete without a sturdy roof, the interior of the home is also incomplete without a perfect ceiling. Nowadays the ceiling and the fifth wall is very demanding in a world of interior design that almost always favored the floor and the four walls. As we all know that false ceiling designs have been around for years, they&rsquo;re coming back with new amendments such as patterns, finishes, technology, and illusion.</p>
<p>A false ceiling is a fitted ceiling that hangs below the original ceiling of a room or home. It&rsquo;s usually suspended with the help of wooden or metal frames and the illusion it brings of a lower ceiling, sometimes with parts of the original ceiling on display, has earned it the moniker &lsquo;dropped ceiling &lsquo;</p>
<p>False ceiling is usually mounted at a minimum distance of 8 to 10 inches from the original ceiling. They&rsquo;re versatile and customizable enough to be constructed in the ceiling of any size- it&rsquo;s all about having a clear mindset or clever with the shapes and the available space.
